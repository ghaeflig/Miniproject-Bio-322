# Miniproject-Bio-322

The goal of this project is to predict the perceived pleasantness of an odour based on some molecular features in a regression task.

Our repository is composed :
- Src folder : it contains the code which is organized in 3 jupyter notebooks. One for each part of the project : exploration, linear method and non-linear method.
- Data folder : it contains the training data that we used to find relevant models, the test data that we used to do our Kaggle submission after selecting the best predicted models on the training data. It contains also an example of a Kaggle submission and our two submissions : one with neuronal network and one with gradient boosting. The code to fill this files is furnished in the notebooks
- The report : It is a pdf file that summarize our results and our decision process.
- The readme

Our results can be reproduced by using R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05).
